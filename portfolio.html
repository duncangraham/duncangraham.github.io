    <p class="space-top">I spent 5 days at CERN as a designer and front end developer in the <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3026107/tribeca-and-cern-want-to-change-storytelling-with-a-hackathon">Tribeca Film Insititute's Storymatter Hackathon</a>. During that time I collaborated with scientists, filmographers, and a backend developer to make an educational webapp focused on an ongoing experiment studying the gravitional effects on antimatter. <a href="http://antimatter.meteor.com">Check out the alpha version!</a></p>

    <p class="space-top">It's time to marry news, current technology, and our mobile habits. Above is my vision for the future: an app that balances personal choice, technological prowess and editorial savvy. The main page would be a feed of the news items deigned by editors to be neccessary for cultural literacy.</p>

    <p>Users would choose how much time they wanted to invest on each item, and would subsequently be served atomic slices of news related to the story and personalized to their knowledge of the subject & context. Meta information, such as relevant persons and orgaizations, would allow users to educate themselves on the context.</p>

    <img src="/img/startupshelllogo.png" />
    <p class="space-top space-bottom">The startup shell is the University of Maryland's student run startup incubator. I helped create it and was the sole designer for its first year of existence. During this time I named the venture and did all of the branding and initial web & print work. 3 other members and I made the logo a permanent fixture in the space when we undertook an 8 hour/40 sqft marathon painting session.</p>
