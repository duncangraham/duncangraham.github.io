<p class="l-font-center">these are some things I want to work on. Some are half baked and still need some love. If you want to collaborate (or tell me that they already exist) drop me a line: hello@dvncan.com or <a href="http://twitter.com/duncangraham">@duncangraham</a></p>

    <h2>Wikipedia Gems</h2>
    <p>I've found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">really</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_drivek">really</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_bulb_mania">interesting</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_sandwich">things</a> on Wikipedia. I'm not sure what form the project would take (curated list, exploration game, etc), but I think with minimal collective effort, we could mine wikipedia for its gems.</p>

    <h2>Harmonics and Canvas</h2>
    <p>I want to use canvas, the HTML5 audio API, and the keyboard to make an interactive learning tool. You would be able to press down on individual keys (A through G) to see their wavelengths. Combinations of keys would demonstrate the reasons why different pairs of notes sound better or worse together. This is one instance in a collection of ideas based on the concept of representing one sensory experience through another to gleam insight.</p>

    <h2>Webcam Emotions</h2>
    <p>Using the webcam, I want to make and display a digital map of the user's face. I think I could make digital approxiamations for the resting shapes of the eyes/mouth. Then, I want to add <a href="http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/84056/tickled-kitten-o.gif">a stimuli</a> and guess what emotion it illicits based on the changes in the digital map</p>

    <h2>Twitter Network Analysis</h2>
    <p>I want to find the holes in my digital network. Bear with me on this one. I'm going take the people I follow ( (me-allUsers)+follow ) and look at who they follow ( ((me-allUsers)+follow)-allUsers)+follow ). I want to take that list and find the people in it that i don't follow, then sort descending by how many times they appear in my peripheral network. Just writing that made me want to find/make a better way to notate network relationships.</p>
