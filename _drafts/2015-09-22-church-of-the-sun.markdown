<h2>Day 1: September 21st, 2015</h2>
<h3>Sunrise</h3>
I woke up early in Baltimore, witnessed the sunrise on an empty street and then drove to catch a flight back to SF. 

<h3>Sunset</h3>
Roux and I watched the sunset from the western side of Bernal Hill. A few friends and couples were already soaking in the last of the rays on some benches. Even more people were out with their dogs or on runs.
Looking at the houses stacked on top of one another up the side of Bernal Hill, I was struck by the variety of window treatments. Light is such an important part of architecture, and my thoughts drifted around this topic (1).

<h2>Day 2: September 22st, 2015</h2>
<h3>Sunrise</h3>
Fearing that I wasn't going to find a good vantage point in time, I scrambled up Protrero Hill in the minutes before the sunrise. I ended my hunt at the end of a road marked with grafitti of a sun. I wonder how many people have used this same spot for sunrises. I wonder how many others are witnessing it with me.


<h3>Sunset</h3>
Pure Fog. Some days you just can't win. At 7PM I felt so incredibly tired.


<h2>Day 3: September 23rd, 2015</h2>
<h3>Sunrise</h3>
Skateboarded with Roux to the spot I found yesterday. Much clearer conditions, though I felt like I should have arrived 15 minutes earlier.

Afterwards, I was getting coffee at Sightglass and a dude told me about [sungazing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungazing) ([for a better wikipedia reading experience I made this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wikireadia/jojdopcdjikalemcbjommjnjfencaghn)). Holy shit! DISCLAIMER: I'm not staring directly at the sun.

<h3>Sunset</h3>
Watched at the corner of Treat and 23rd in the Mission. Fantastic colors. The realization that I'm more than halfway through this experiment.

<h2>Day 4: September 23rd, 2015</h2>
<h3>Sunrise</h3>
