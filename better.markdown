<p class="first-paragraph">Our success as a species is due to an unmatched prediliction to better our lives & environments through tool making. With the exponential progress we're currently experiencing though, I wonder if we've developed the ability to criticize as well as we've developed the ability to create. How good are we at answering the question, "Is this better?".</p>

*TWO DISCLAIMERS: 1) some tools make life livable. Others make it wonderful. I am not referring to these. 2) Arguably, human habits are part of the problem. But if such habits are facilitated/created/engendered by the tool, then the tool is ultimately to blame.*

## Snoozing

Snoozing has been a problem of mine for years. If given the option, I’ll snooze every chance I get. The self induced sleep limbo leaves me groggy and wastes 5-30 minutes most mornings [1]. I’ve seen new products like fitbits [http://www.fitbit.com/force#sleep-well]  and apps [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-alarm-clock/id320606217?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D2] that try to fix the problem. but none have ever made my mornings significantly better. If anything they contribute to the delusion that technology will solve all of our ailments.

But what if there wasn't a snooze button? An even more radical idea, what if there was no alarm? The safety net of the alarm clock allows for the habit. Without the technologic control, the habit is much harder to live with. **If the tool was removed, I asked, would the bad habit persist?**

I stopped using an alarm for two weeks to find out. Below is the data.

[insert graphic, once completed]

Every morning I woke up before the desired time, usually never more than 30 minutes and sometimes as close as 2 minutes to the time. I was surprised by the experiment. I wondered if I was experiencing a sort of placebo effect: Because I wanted to eschew an alarm clock, my mind made it so. With minimal research, I found a study that illuminated my own findings.

"The body is essentially a collection of clocks," says [Satchindananda Panda](http://www.salk.edu/faculty/panda.html), an associate professor in Salk's Regulatory Biology Laboratory [*SALK]

Researchers at the Salk institute for Biological Studies (Designed by my favorite architect, Louis Kahn) discovered the gene responsible for this internal clock mechanism [SALK]. It doesn’t explain the near precision I found in my experiment, but they do note in the study that JARID1a (the protein responsible for activating the internal alarm) degrades over time. If I continued the data collection, it’s likely I’d see more varied results over time.

So, there is something internal that may be partially responsible for the data!

the alarm clock I thought was indispensable was actually a detriment. Removing it has made waking up a joy, so how did this feature catch on in the first place?

## Genesis of Detriments

As old as alarm clocks are[7], the snooze button is a relatively new invention, born in 1959 with the release of the Westclox Drowse electric clock [8]. In 2000 the "drowse" button was renamed to the snooze we know of today. 





## Facebook

I'd argue that the leading tool for social connecting in the digital age is increasingly making us feel more alone [3]. We've convinced ourselves that the tool makes things better or easier, but we're getting a watered down version of reality at best, and a poisoned one at worst.

For a social connection to be made, there needs to be an exchange of recognition. Facebook facilitates this with Likes [4], comments, and messages, but I would posit that these exchanges are in the minority and that most "connections" are singular and, by that characteristic, passive. We are becoming digital [5] wallflowers.

This is hurting both parties. The onlookers gleam a false sense of connection, while the looked upon (with no likes or comments) are shouting and sharing into the perceived digital void.

I deleted my Facebook 7 month ago and without the tool my social life has flourished. [FLUSH OUT? DELETE THE PERSONAL?]

Facebook is an example that doesn't warrant deletion, but heavy editing. The product needs a massive shift in purpose and execution if it is going to stay relevant. Otherwise I think we'll see an exodus as individuals become aware of their habits.

## In Closing

How many other tools fit in this box? How many deserve to be abandoned? As a designer I've already begun to examine not only the products I use, but the ones I spend time making. It's depressing to see the things I've made under the assumption of necessity that don't hold up under scrutiny.

The two I’ve come up with so far are
Last Pass  because http://xkcd.com/936/
and my phone because http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzpX0TLKS9Q

If you decide to try out either experiment or know of other examples, I'd love to hear from you: hello@dvncan.com.

## Footnotes
1. The worst occurrence happened during charrette when I performed the groggy button mashing at 5 minute intervals for over 2 hours.
2. add a shitload of links 
2. SALK http://www.salk.edu/news/pressrelease_details.php?press_id=521
3. Facebook does certain things well of course (like chat). And Again, these observations a derived from the bubble of experiences from myself and close friends.
4. link to article on how likes are a poor form of communication
5. Malicious or not, the common nomenclature supports this. Facebook, at least in it's infancy was born with the purpose of stalking. also, a thought: are words Analog: the derivation or similarity to something, and Analog: the clock type related? How?
6. The first clocks were sundials, but the first alarm is thought to have originated with water clocks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water-powered_clock
7. to the best of my knowledge http://clockhistory.com/westclox/products/electric/drowse/index.html
8. http://quickhistory.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/history-of-snooze-button/ nit sure if its legit, but its entertaining
