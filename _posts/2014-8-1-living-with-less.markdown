A year ago I moved from my house in DC to the suburbs. It was only 7 miles away, but took an entire weekend and 3 trips with a pickup truck. It was an annoying way to realize how much stuff I had amassed over the years, and how it weighed me down. After the move, I decided to give myself a year to get down to 100 possessions.

After a year of donating books and clothes, decluttering, and changing my purchasing habits, I moved to San Francisco two days ago with 2 backpacks stuffed with the result of my efforts. Here's what I brought with me:

<h2>Clothing (54)</h2>
<ul class="l-col-3">
<li>5 Button Up</li>
<li>1 Jeans</li>
<li>8 T-shirts</li>
<li>2 Longsleeves</li>
<li>4 Shorts</li>
<li>1 Bathing Suit</li>
<li>3 Jackets</li>
<li>2 Sweaters</li>
<li>3 Tank Tops</li>
<li>1 Watch</li>
<li>1 Sunglasses</li>
<li>1 Oliver Peoples</li>
<li>1 Belt</li>
<li>4 Athletic Gear</li>
<li>11 Boxer-Briefs</li>
<li>1 Running Shoes</li>
<li>1 Common Projects</li>
<li>1 Flip Flops</li>
<li>1 Slippers</li>
<li>1 Robe</li>
<li>1 Warm Hat</li>
</ul>
<small>I need to buy some socks. I didn't donate or pitch any but over the course of the year they all dissapeared on their own-- as socks do.</small>

<h2>Electronics (5)</h2>
<ul class="l-col-3">
<li>1 Kindle Paperwhite</li>
<li>1 2012 Macbook Pro 13"</li>
<li>1 iPhone 5</li>
<li>1 Headphones</li>
<li>1 1TB Hard Drive</li>
</ul>
<small>I'm not counting the chargers, mostly because one without the other is pointless. It would be like counting a pair of pants as two individual things. Coincidentally, I saw someone today only wearing one pant leg.</small>


<h2>Dog (6)</h2>
<ul class="l-col-3">
<li>1 Leash</li>
<li>2 Dog Bowls</li>
<li>1 Fluffy Blanket</li>
<li>1 Crate</li>
<li>1 Dog Toy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Random (8)</h2>
<ul class="l-col-3">
<li>1 Dopp Kit</li>
<li>2 Books</li>
<li>2 Old Sketchbooks</li>
<li>1 New Sketchbook</li>
<li>1 GoRuck 20L</li>
<li>1 Osprey Exos 58L</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<small>Not counting toothbrush, contacts, comb, etc. I make the rules in my own game. Also, The books are American Gods and The Initiates, if you were interested.</small>

<h2>TOTAL: 74!</h2>

So, I hit my goal, but only by bending the rules a bit. I still have a bicycle, some books, a suit, a tux, and some aartwork back home that I'll be flying out in the next few weeks. As noted above, I'll probably buy some more socks too. I'll need some silverware and furniture most likely, which will probably put me a little bit past the mark. But not by much!

<script type="text/javascript">
$('h1').lettering();

function fadeLetter (el) {
  $('.'+el).animate({color: '#DADADA'}, 1000);  
}

$('.char2').animate({ color: '#DADADA' }, 1000,
  function() {
    $('.char4').animate({ color: '#DADADA' }, 1000,
    function() {
      $('.char9').animate({ color: '#DADADA'}, 1000,    
      function() {
        $('.char14').animate({ color: '#DADADA'}, 1000);
      })
   })
});
</script>
