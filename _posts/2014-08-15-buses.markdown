This past weekend I participated in the <a href="http://asa-datathon.github.io/">ASA Datathon</a>. My team asked the question, 'Does SF public transportation underserve those in low-income communities or without cars?' We couldn't find conclusive evidence,  but we did draw some interesting conclusions. Below is the presentation we gave.  <a href="/buses.html">Here's the visualization we used heavily to explore the data</a>. 

Want to get involved? I'm working on adding realtime aspects to the viz, as well as other layers of data. <a href='https://github.com/duncangraham/sf-bus-data'>Here's the repo on Github</a> and <a href='https://modeanalytics.com/derek/reports/3faf34b0bfcb'>Here's the data set on Mode</a>.

Oh also, we won! Thanks to all of the judges and organizers.
