<a href="http://asherv.com/threes/">Threes!</a> is a game about making pairs of increasing value. It begins with a 4X4 grid of seven empty spaces<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> and nine filled randomly with 1's, 2's, and 3's. you slide the pieces orthoganally to combine like numbers, building up to bigger and bigger values. After a few days of play, I've figured out a solid strategy and a few supporting techniques.</p>

<h2>THE GUIDING RULE: Push ruthlessly towards a corner</h2>

Push your largest piece to your chosen corner, then use the rest of the board to build up to that number. The two adjacent walls to your chosen corner should hold a blocks that, when combined with one another, can be built up to the corner value. The opposite walls and middle space are your playground. Get blocks in here to the adjacent walls.

Once locked into this type of game, breaking this rule for almost any reason has marked the beginning of the end of me.

**The supporting rules (not necessarily in order of importance, and always secondary)**

1. Make as many combinations as possible per turn. Freeing up board space gives you more wiggle room, and with wiggle room comes better options. If you can't make multiple pairings...
2. Set yourself up for pairings. If you have four 3's near one another, you can probably make a 2 pair in as many turns.
3. Find paths. Two 3's that set you up to combine with a 6 that sets you  up to combine with a 12 that sets...you get it.
3. get rid of 1's and 2's quickly. they are the bane of the board.

1. The phrase empty space sounds redundant.
