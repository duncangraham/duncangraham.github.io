I've been having a blast with language recently, and I figured I'd share some of things I've learned that I've found particularly interesting.

### 5.30.17
<h5>
    <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=advantage">
        Advantage
    </a>
</h5>
"Life is a playground if you make it one. You just have to take advantage of it". My sister Maria said this. I looked up the etymology of advantage and found it's the "position of being in advance of another".

### 5.30.17
<h5>
    <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=current">
        Finial
    </a>

     Christian yelled down from the loft- "Did you know the end of a bannister is called a Finial??". I didn't and so I looked up the etymology: Ornament at the top of a spire, gable, etc.," mid-15c., from fyniall "putting an end to, binding" (early 15c.), a variant of final.

</h5>




### 5.29.17

<h5>
    <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=current">
        Current
    </a>
</h5>
I was making some updates to dvncan.com and Mom said that I was keeping it current. I laughed when I thought of the word when used describing water in a [river](https://books.google.com/books?id=putbK6p2o4sC&q=river#v=onepage&q&f=false). Always changing, but always now.

<h5>
    <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=person">
        Person
    </a>
</h5>
Orginating from the Latin Persona: a mask or false face. Later, A part in a drama, an assumed character.

<h5>Indifference</h5>
An old friend asked me what the hostel has been like. I said that it's been so enriching to be able to interact with people from all over with such varied lives. And despite the endless variation, I've come to feel deeply that, "we have in in common than in..." I struggled to find a word. Then said the first that came to mind, "...difference"

Indifference: lack of interest, concern, or sympathy.

When you self identify, you become disconnected, different from the underlying completeness of everything. From <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13">Corinthians</a>, "For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears." It's a state in difference from the completeness. Indifference. Too funny.
