In March of 2014, I spent 5 days at <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/">CERN</a>, the European Organization for Nuclear Research as a "blackbox" (designer, developer, storyteller) in the <a href="https://tribecafilminstitute.org/events/detail/tribeca_hacks_story_matter">Tribeca Film Institutes Storymatter hackathon</a>. During this time I worked with an incredible team of filmographers, developers, and scientists to build an interactive educational experience based around a current experiment on the gravitational properties of antimatter.

While the hackathon's notceable lack of constraints left some teams feeling directionless, my team knew from an early moment what we wanted to accomplish: an educational, interactive video experience. Working with such a diverse group (a backend developer, a creative director/filmographer, a film & neuroscience student, and a scientist)
