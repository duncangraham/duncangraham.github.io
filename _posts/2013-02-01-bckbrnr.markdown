Bckbrnr was a productivity and project management tool I built to keep track of the variety of side projects I'm undertaking at any time.

It was a great experience to build a webapp from scratch, but I realized that what I had built, though minimal, was adding to my workload. Rather than continuing the project, I instead decided to hone my discipline, willpower, and memory. The results have been more impressive than any technological tool I've tried.
