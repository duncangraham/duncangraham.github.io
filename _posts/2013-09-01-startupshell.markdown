At the end of my time at the University of Maryland  I helped create the Startup Shell, a student run startup accelerator. When I joined, there was no website, branding, or location-- only an idea.

I began branding work with the original name in mind-- eT Labs (short for enTerprenuerial). After <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RmTh6geSDsVRQNGmihfyA3RpGnV-qjA_qYKOl7Wj2aw/edit?usp=sharing">a few iterations</a> we ran into legal red tape with the name, so we went back to the drawing board. After dozens of proposals, I pitched "Startup Shell", along with some early branding work.

After a vote, the other founding members chose to go forward with StartupShell, and I began polishing the logo.

While I was finishing the logo, we had found a physical location for the Shell. As an inaugural celebration, we painted a 10 foot logo on one wall.

In 2 hours I made <a href="http://dvncan.com/mocks/startupshell/">our first website</a>. Since then we've grown up a bit. We're mentoring almost 10 times as many student companies.
