I was reading an article on the Washington Post not long ago and I was struck by how little space was afforded to the actual content of the article. At the worst point, the article body fills less than a fifth of the screen. Most of the area is taken up by ads or links to other articles.  

<br/>

Looking at the New York Times, I saw the same layout.

So in the spirit of solving a problem rather than complaining about it, I built a chrome extension to fix the issue. It removes anything I thought was visual clutter and leaves the actual content of the article, surrounded by gorgeous white space.
