This project is ongoing, but I'm too excited not to share some of the work I've been doing.


The original Washington Post Live Blog was created in a rush and, while functional, needed a visual refresh to better serve the needs of  readers & reporters.

After talking to reporters and learning about users experience's and favorite features, I began iterating on the refresh.

After figuring out the general iA and  setting a grid, I began typographic iterations.

Here's where the design is currently. I'm working on adding views for the live chat aspect of the product.
