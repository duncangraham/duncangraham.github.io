This project is ongoing, but I'm too excited not to share some of the work I've been doing.


The original Washington Post Live Blog was created in a rush and, while functional, needed a visual refresh to better serve the needs of  readers & reporters.

After talking to reporters and learning about users experience's and favorite features, I began iterating on the refresh.

After figuring out the general iA and  setting a grid, I began typographic iterations.

And here is the finished template design! The left bar is a collection of headers of all updates, linked to the full posts.

A concern that was brought up while I was designing the template was how commenting would be integrated. After much thought and many discussions, I decided that the user submitted content should fit the product as a whole. For live events a typical commenting system seemed out of place to me, so I proposed integrating a live chat.
