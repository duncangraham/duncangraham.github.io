<h3>Visual Stream</h3>

<p>I'm ambivalent about Dribbble, but want to show some recent things I've been kicking around</p>

<h3>Lettering project</h3>
        <img class='space-top1' src='/img/fortune1.png' />
        <img src='/img/fortune2.png' />
        <img src='/img/fortune3.png' />
        <img src='/img/fortune4.png' />
        <img src='/img/fortune5.png' />
        <img src='/img/fortune-fancy.png' />

        <img src='/img/fortune-letter-final.png' />
        <img src='/img/fortune-polish.png' />
        <small>This background image had way too many vertical lines that competed with the letter forms</small>
        <img src='/img/fortune-final.png' />
        <small>The background is much more organic, which lets the rigid words pop more. I also like the figure in the foreground and the horizontality. That said...</small>
        <img src='/img/fortune-iphone.png' />
        <small>Here's a version that you can use on your iPhone, if you dig it.</small>


<h3>Flake: A fast way to make plans that actually happen.</h3>

        <small>The initial branding concepts</small>

        <small>barf. looks crisp but too facebook-y</small>
        <img src='/img/flake-fun.png' />
        <small>Injecting some personality (and making everything less Facebook-y)</small>
