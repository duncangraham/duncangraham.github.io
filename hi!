hi!
im dvncan

a designer & developer
living in dc

designer and developer
for the washington post

architecture student
turned programmer // turned to the web
morphed with UI designer/web designer/

i was an
architecture student ( link to UMD )

who saw a connection to code
and turned to programming and the web

because most architecture
won't reach the 
scale of audience 
that the web will

loves:
typography
coffee
chopping wood (link to best made)
motorcycles
running
traveling
scotch

i want the web
brough more joy
to the world

so i'm making
things to do
just
that

I love coffee, beer, scotch, water
and good conversation

avid coffee enthusiast.
(maybe a little overboard)


send me an email 
if you want to meet up

want to grab a coffee?
(or beer?)

sounds good,
you seem pretty cool

shoot me an email
hello@dvncan.com



i tweet
and take photos

i'm open to
selective
freelance opportunites

but

i devote my time
to only the
things 
I'm most
passionate about

 
if you've gotten
down this far

it's your lucky day!

a haiku for you:

beautiful diamond
mesmerizing with colors
your new overlord





that's the end
it'll restart

if you keep
scrolling
